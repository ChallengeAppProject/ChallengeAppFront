# ChallengeApp

Challenge App is a project that was devised to cover a specific training need, either within a company or in the educational field.
It is an application that generates test-type exams ("Challenges") in which it is the client himself who can create the Challenges and assign the participants to them.

The goal of this project has been to learn how to connect Back-end and Front-end, developing a MVC architecture with layers, in wich a DTO layer isolate the Controller layer of the Domain layer
